# rock-paper-scissors-gen-1-
A very crappy rock paper scissors game. Made by a newb with no assistance.

I started my journey with python a little over 2 months ago.
I used an app called mimo which gave me a good understanding of some basic concepts but no real application
This is the first real program I've written on my own without guidance.

It took me about 45 minutes to get it to this stage.
Since then (at time of posting) I've spent about 2 hours trying to figure out best way to check if user input is valid.
Right now if you spell rock, paper, or scissors wrong you auto lose the hand.

I will figure out best way to implement a validity check on input answer and possibly try and rewrite this in OOP.

The game places you against the PC in a best of 3 rock, paper, scissors game. 

edit: i came up with a funny way to handle if the player inputs something other than rock, paper, scissors. couldn't figure out how to make it just ask the question again until you get  a valid response but i think this fix is funny and i was able to come up with how to do this now so i did. also i am much happier with how it checks for winners.
